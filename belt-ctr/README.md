Generic implementation of the [`belt-ctr`] block mode of operation.

Mode functionality is accessed using traits from the [`cipher`] crate.

# ⚠️ Security Warning: Hazmat!

This crate does not ensure ciphertexts are authentic! Thus ciphertext integrity
is not verified, which can lead to serious vulnerabilities!
[AEADs] provide simple authenticated encryption,
which is much less error-prone than manual integrity verification.

# Example
```
use hex_literal::hex;
use belt_ctr::{BeltCtr, cipher::{KeyIvInit, StreamCipher, StreamCipherSeek}};

let key = &[0x42; 32];
let iv = &[0x24; 16];
let plaintext: &[u8; 34] = b"hello world! this is my plaintext.";
let ciphertext: &[u8; 34] = &hex!(
    "38DF06243BD85DA1CAE597CE680D3AFE"
    "0EBB372A4F6A858DB2DBE20A63567EED"
    "7D1B"
);

let mut cipher: BeltCtr = BeltCtr::new_from_slices(key, iv).unwrap();

// encrypt in-place
let mut buf = plaintext.clone();
cipher.apply_keystream(&mut buf);
assert_eq!(buf[..], ciphertext[..]);

cipher.seek(0);
cipher.apply_keystream(&mut buf);
assert_eq!(buf[..], plaintext[..]);
```
